Branch - CSE

I am fresher in CSE department at IIT Guwahati.
I love to play flute and also love to play Volleyball.
I am currently working on Competitive Programming and also learning new things like open sourve, app dev and web dev.


I want to contribute to open source because I want to give my contribution in various big projects and hence improve my coding skills by recieving feedback from various developers. I also want to make my own projects and work with fellow developers and to learn new things from them.
