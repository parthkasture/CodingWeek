Hello! I am fresher in CSE department at IIT Guwahati. 
I love to play flute and also love to play Volleyball. 
Currently I am working on Competitive Programming and learning new things like open source,app dev and web dev.


I want to contribute to open source because I want to contribute in different projects and learn new things and to improve my coding skills by recieving feedback from different developers. I want to build my own projects in which various people can contribute.
